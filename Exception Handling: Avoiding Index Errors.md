# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

##  Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

##  Algorithm
1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## Program
```
try:
    # Taking 3 elements input from the user
    L = []
    for i in range(3):
        item = ['laptop','mobile','pen']
        L.append(item)

    # Trying to access index 4
    print(L[4])
except IndexError:
    print("check index range")
```
## Output
<img width="506" height="225" alt="544838425-9aee233d-cd65-4268-a137-b1ec43f1365c" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d73ea2e4-f57c-4aa2-833f-14e321fb4807" />

## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.
